# 1D wave equation in C

This version of the time stepper uses `getopt` to process input
arguments from the command line, and uses the
[`ldoc`](https://github.com/dbindel/ldoc) documentation generator
to produce a ["literate program"](wave_demo.html) that mixes code
and associated documentation.  We have also now done some tuning for
serial performance.
